Give file structure first, static template folders, file code, README.md, json for all files last. Dont explain running input or overview or license: I need a website that keeps track of peoples mothers and phone number and their relationship status and husbands work schedule 

give me the project formatted as a json with file and folder names as keys, and file contents as values. 
# Example:
output.json:
[
{
"root-folder":
{
"README.md": "# Inventory Website\n\nThis is a simple website where users can...",
"app.py": "from flask import Flask...",
"requirements.txt": "Flask==..." 
}
]
